** Teaching Modelling with One-Dimensional Cellular Autoama **
Self-Learning material for Kantonsschulen in German-Speaking Switzerland 
Part of Didaktik der Informatik 1.2 at FHNW (www.fhnw.ch) 
Summer Semester 2025

Cellular Automata are known models for various phenomena in science and nature. 
The students are exposed to the definition of cellular automata and investigate several models. 

The simulation code and visualization is written in Javascript, so the students can 
use any given browser.

Supported models: 
* "elementary", i.e. 2 states, 1D, direct neighbors
* Heat exchange, 256 values, new state is weighted average
* Double Red, turns blue cells into two red cells, 3 states, example for a non-trivial invariance
* (Planned) various sea shell pattern following the book "The algorithmic beauty of sea shells" by Hans Meinhardt
* reverse pattern
* firing squad
